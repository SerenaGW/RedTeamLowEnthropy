# RedTeamLowEnthropy
This repository documents ongoing research into Low-Entropy Languages (LEL), an unconventional vector for red teaming large language models (LLMs). An LEL is defined as a non-traditional input system that possesses minimal statistical or semantic uncertainty when processed by the model's tokenizer and inference engine.
